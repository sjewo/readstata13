Package to read and write all Stata file formats (version 17 and older) into a
R data.frame. The dta file format versions 102 to 119 are supported.

The function ```read.dta``` from the foreign package imports only dta files from
Stata versions <= 12. Due to the different structure and features of dta 117
files, we wrote a new file reader in Rcpp.

Additionally the package supports many features of the Stata dta format like
label sets in different languages (`?set.lang`) or business calendars
(`?as.caldays`).


## Installation

The package is hosted on CRAN.
```R
install.packages("readstata13")
```

## Usage
```R
library(readstata13)
dat <- read.dta13("path to file.dta")
save.dta13(dat, file="newfile.dta")
```

## Development Version
To install the current release from github you need the platform specific build
tools. On Windows a current installation of
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is necessary, while OS X
users need to install
[Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). 

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sjewo/readstata13", ref="0.10.0")
```

Older Versions of devtools require a username option:
```R
install_github("readstata13", username="sjewo", ref="0.10.0")
```

To install the current development version from github:

```R
devtools::install_github("sjewo/readstata13", ref="testing")
```

## readstata13 and foreign

Most attributes of the resulting data.frame are largely similar to the data.frames produced by `foreign`. 
Since newer Stata files require some additional attributes, the results of `all.equal()` and `identical()` will be `FALSE` for data.frames read by `foreign::read.dta` and `read.dta13()`.
Otherwise, the data.frames produced by both functions are identical.

```R
library(foreign)
library(readstata13)

# with factors
r12 <- read.dta("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r12/auto.dta")
r13 <- read.dta13("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r13/auto.dta")

all.equal(r12, r13, check.attributes = FALSE)

# without factors
r12 <- read.dta("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r12/auto.dta", 
                convert.factors = FALSE)
r13 <- read.dta13("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r13/auto.dta", 
                  convert.factors = FALSE)

all.equal(r12, r13, check.attributes = FALSE)
```
