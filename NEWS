testing
- Stop compression of doubles as floats. Now test if compression of doubles as
  interger types is possible.

0.8.3
- restrict length of varnames to 32 chars for compatibility with Stata 14

0.8.2
- save NA values in character vector as empty string
- convert.underscore=T will convert all non-literal characters to underscores
- fix saving of Dates
- save with convert.factors by default
- test for NaN and inf values while writing missing values and replace with NA
- remove message about saving factors

0.8.1
- convert non-integer variables to factors (nonint.factors=T)
- working with strL variables is now a lot faster (thank to Magnus Thor Torfason)
- fix handling of large datasets
- some code cleanups

0.8
- implement reading all version prior 13.
- clean up code.
- fix a crash when varlables do not match ncols.
- update leap seconds R code with foreign.

0.7.1
- fix saving of files > 2GB

0.7
- read and write Stata 14 files (ver 118)
- fix save for variables without non-missing values
- read strings from different file encodings
- code cleanups

0.6.1
- fix heap overflow

0.6
- various fixes
- reading stbcal-files

0.5
- write dta-files
- read/write LSF and MSF files
- source testing and cleaning
- support for multiple label languages (see http://www.stata.com/manuals13/dlabellanguage.pdf)
- additional tools for label handling

0.4
- convert.dates from foreign::read.dta()
- handle different NA values
- convert strings to system encoding
- some checks on label assignment

0.3
- reading file from url.
  Example: `read.dta13("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r13/auto.dta")`
- convert.underscore from foreign::read.dta(): converts _ to .
- missing.type parts from foreign::read.dta(). If TRUE return "missing"
- replace.strl option to replace the reference to a STRL string in the data.frame with the actual value

0.2
- read stata characteristics and save them in extension.table attribute
- more robust handling of factor labels
- set file encoding for all strings and convert them to system encoding
- fixed compiler warnings

0.1
- reading data files and create a data.frame
- assign variable names
- read the new strL strings and save them as attribute
- convert stata label to factors and save them as attribute
- read some meta data (timestamp, dataset label, formats,...)
