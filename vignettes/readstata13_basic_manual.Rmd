The `readstata13` package was developed to address compatibility issues arising from changes in the Stata 13 dta file format. Prior to Stata 13, packages like `foreign` could handle dta files. However, Stata 13 introduced a new format that resembles XML.[^1] Recognizing the need for a new solution, we (Jan Marvin Garbuszus and Sebastian Jeworutzki) created `readstata13`. Leveraging Rcpp for performance, the package has evolved into a comprehensive tool for working with dta files in R.

[^1]: The dta format for current versions is well documented at <https://www.stata.com/help.cgi?dta> and also in the corresponding manuals.

Key features of `readstata13` include:

* **Broad Format Support:** Ability to import and export dta files across a wide range of Stata versions, including many undocumented formats.
* **Handling Advanced Features:** Support for features like string encoding, multilingual labels, business calendars, long strings (`strL`), frames, and embedded binary data.
* **Enhanced Functionality:** Built as a direct replacement for `foreign`'s dta functions, with added capabilities for improved label handling (including generation) and partial data reading (selecting specific rows or variables).

## Core Functionality: Reading and Writing Stata files

Importing a Stata file using `readstata13` is straightforward, similar to using the `foreign` package. The primary function is `read.dta13`. To save an R data frame to the Stata dta format, you use the `save.dta13` function.

```{R}
data (cars)

# Save the 'cars' dataset to a Stata file
save.dta13(cars, file = "res/cars.dta")

# Read the saved Stata file back into R
dat <- read.dta13("res/cars.dta")
```

Beyond the data itself, `readstata13` preserves important metadata from the Stata file. This information is stored as attributes of the imported data frame.

```{R}
# prints the attributes
attributes(dat)
```

Examining the attributes reveals details such as the Stata format version (e.g., format 117, introduced in Stata 13), a data label, a timestamp, and information about the data types and formats used in Stata. In this example, the `save.dta13` function wrote the numeric data from R as binary `double`s in the dta file. The byte order (endianness) is also recorded; `readstata13` is designed to handle both Little Endian (used here) and Big Endian formats during reading and writing.[^2]

[^2]: A detailed explanation can be found here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness>.

The package automatically manages the conversion of Stata's missing values, value labels, and variable labels during both import and export.

## Supported Stata Versions

A key advantage of `readstata13` is its ability to write dta files compatible with older and newer versions of Stata. This is controlled using the `version` argument in the `save.dta13` function. The table below lists supported Stata versions and their corresponding file formats:

| Stata Version | File Format |
|---------------|-------------|
| 18 - 19       | 121         |
| 18 - 19       | 120         |
| 15 - 19       | 119         |
| 14 - 19       | 118         |
| 13            | 117         |
| 12            | 115         |
| 10 - 11       | 114         |
| 8 - 9         | 113         |
| 7             | 110         |
| 6             | 108         |

While this table shows the most common formats, `readstata13` supports reading files from Stata version 1 (format 102) up to the latest format 121 (used for files with over 32,767 variables, readable by Stata 18 & 19 MP).[^4] The dta format has evolved over time to accommodate larger datasets and longer variable names or labels. Although `readstata13` can read virtually any format, its ability to write files that *fit* within Stata's historical limits depends on the data size. For general compatibility, it's recommended to target versions 7 or later (formats 110+), which aligns with the default in `foreign::write.dta`.

[^4]: A [development branch](https://github.com/sjewo/readstata13/tree/116) on GitHub even include support for the rarely seen `116` format, for which only one public sample file is known to exist.

Here's an example of saving a file compatible with Stata 7:

```{r}
# Save the cars dataset as a Stata 7 dta file
save.dta13(cars, "res/cars_version.dta", version = 7)

# Read the file back and check its reported version
dat3 <- read.dta13("res/cars_version.dta")
attr(dat3, "version")
```

## Working with Labelled Data

Stata datasets often include rich metadata like variable and value labels. Since base R data frames don't natively support this, `readstata13` stores this information in various attributes of the imported data frame, mirroring the approach used by `foreign::read.dta`.

Let's use the example dataset "statacar.dta" included with the `readstata13` package. We'll initially import it without converting categorical data to R factors, keeping the original numeric codes.

```{r}
library(readstata13)
x <- read.dta13(system.file("extdata/statacar.dta",
                            package = "readstata13"),
                convert.factors = FALSE)
```

Variable labels are accessible via the `var.labels` attribute:

```{r}
attr(x, "var.labels")
```

You can retrieve the label for a specific variable using the `varlabel()` function:

```{r}
varlabel(x, var.name = "type")
```

Value labels, which map numeric codes to descriptive text, are stored in a more structured way. The `val.labels` attribute indicates which variables have associated value labels. The actual label definitions (the mapping from codes to labels) are stored as a list in the `label.table` attribute.

In our example dataset, only one column has value labels:

```{r}
attr(x, "val.labels")
```

The corresponding label table for the 'type' variable is named `type_en`. It's a named vector where the numeric codes are the vector values and the labels are the names:

```{r}
attr(x, "label.table")$type_en
```

Convenience functions like `get.label.name()` and `get.label()` provide alternative ways to access this information:

```{r}
get.label.name(x, var.name = "type")
get.label(x, "type_en")
```

A common task is converting a numeric variable with value labels into an R factor. `readstata13` simplifies this with the `set.label()` function, which uses the stored label information to create the factor levels.

```{r}
# Create a factor variable 'type_en' from the 'type' variable using stored labels
x$type_en <- set.label(x, "type")

# Display the original numeric column and the new factor column
x[, c("type", "type_en")]
```

### Multi-Language Support for Labels

Stata allows datasets to include labels in multiple languages. `readstata13` supports this, and the `lang` option in `set.label()` lets you specify which language's labels to use when creating a factor.

```{r}
# Check available languages and the default language
get.lang(x)

# Create a factor using the German labels
x$type_de <- set.label(x, "type", lang = "de")

# Display the original and both language factor columns
x[, c("type", "type_en", "type_de")]
```


### Compatibility with Other Packages

`readstata13` is designed to integrate well with other R packages that work with labelled data, such as `labelled` and `expss`.

```{r, eval = isTRUE(requireNamespace("labelled"))}
# Requires labelled package version > 2.8.0 due to a past bug
library(labelled)

# Read the data and convert to the 'labelled' class format
xl <- read.dta13(system.file("extdata/statacar.dta",
                             package = "readstata13"),
                convert.factors = FALSE)

xl <- to_labelled(xl)
xl
```

Packages like `expss` can utilize the label information stored by `readstata13` (and converted by `labelled`) for creating descriptive tables and plots.

```{r, eval = isTRUE(requireNamespace("expss")) & isTRUE(requireNamespace("labelled"))}
library(expss)

# Example: Use expss to create a table summarizing horse power by car brand
# First, handle missing or negative HP values
xl[xl$hp < 0 | is.na(xl$hp), "hp"] <- NA

# Create the table using expss piping syntax
xl %>%
  tab_cells(hp) %>% # Specify the variable for cells
  tab_cols(brand) %>% # Specify the variable for columns
  tab_stat_mean_sd_n() %>% # Calculate mean, standard deviation, and N
  tab_pivot() %>% # Pivot the table
  set_caption("Horse power by car brand.") # Add a caption
```


## Handling Large Datasets

As datasets grow, importing and managing them in memory can become challenging. `readstata13` provides features to work efficiently with large dta files.

### Partial Reading

To avoid loading an entire large dataset when only a subset is needed, `readstata13` allows you to read specific rows or columns. This is particularly useful for exploring large files or extracting key variables without consuming excessive memory or time.

```{r}
# Read only the first 3 rows of the dataset
dat_1 <- read.dta13("res/cars.dta", select.rows = c(1,3)); dat_1

# Read only the 'dist' variable from the dataset
dat_2 <- read.dta13("res/cars.dta", select.cols = "dist"); head(dat_2)
```

A practical application of partial reading is working with large survey datasets like the SOEP (German Socio-Economic Panel).[^5] These datasets are often distributed across multiple files, structured like tables in a database. To link information across files, you need key identifier variables. Instead of importing entire multi-gigabyte files just to get a few ID columns, you can use `select.cols` to quickly and efficiently read only the necessary variables.

[^5]: The SOEP is currently located at the [DIW Berlin](https://www.diw.de/).

### Compression

When saving data to a dta file, you can use the `compress = TRUE` option in `save.dta13`. This instructs the package to use the smallest possible Stata data type for each variable, potentially reducing the file size.

```{r}
# Save the cars dataset with compression enabled
save.dta13(cars, file = "res/cars_compress.dta", compress = TRUE)

# Import the compressed file and check the resulting data types
dat2 <- read.dta13(file = "res/cars_compress.dta")
attr(dat2, "types")
```

In this example, the `numeric` vector in R was safely stored as an `integer` in the compressed dta file because its values fit within the integer range. The main benefit of compression is the reduction in file size. The only notable change is that after re-import, the former `numeric` column has become an `integer`. 

```{r}
rbind(file.info("res/cars.dta")["size"],
      file.info("res/cars_compress.dta")["size"])
```

## Advanced Features

### Frames

Stata version 16 introduced the concept of data [frames](https://www.stata.com/help.cgi?frames), allowing multiple datasets to be held in memory simultaneously and saved together in a ".dtas" file (a Stata frameset). A ".dtas" file is essentially a zip archive containing a separate dta file for each frame.

The `get.frames` function in `readstata13` can inspect a ".dtas" file and list the names (defined within Stata), the internal filename and version of the frames it contains:

```{r}
dtas_path <- system.file("extdata", "myproject2.dtas",
                         package = "readstata13")

# Get information about frames in the .dtas file
get.frames(dtas_path)
```

To import data from a ".dtas" file, use `read.dtas`. By default, it imports all frames and returns them as a named list of R data frames.

```{r}
# Read all frames from the .dtas file
read.dtas(dtas_path)
```

You can import only specific frames using the `select.frames` argument:

```{r}
# Read only the "counties" frame
read.dtas(dtas_path, select.frames = "counties")
```

Furthermore, you can apply specific `read.dta13` options to individual frames within the ".dtas" file by providing a list to the `read.dta13.options` argument. The list structure should be `list(framename = list(param = value))`.

```{r}
# Read frames with different column selections for each
read.dtas(dtas_path,
          read.dta13.options = list(counties = list(select.cols = "median_income"),
                                    persons = list(select.cols = "income")))
```


### Long Strings (strL) and Binary Data

Stata 13 introduced "long strings" (`strL`), capable of storing very large text values. These are stored separately from the main data matrix in the dta file, with only a reference kept in the data part. `readstata13` handles these; by default, they are read into R character vectors.

Interestingly, Stata also allows embedding binary data (like images, audio, or other files) within `strL` variables.[^6] While R's standard data structures aren't ideal for directly handling such embedded binary data within a data frame,[^7] `readstata13` version `0.9.1` and later provides the `strlexport` option to extract these binary contents to files.

[^6]: A Stata blog post illustrates this feature, showing how physicians could store X-ray images alongside patient data: ["In the spotlight: Storing long strings and entire files in Stata datasets"](https://www.stata.com/stata-news/news31-4/spotlight/).

[^7]: The challenge lies in R's vector types; standard character vectors aren't designed for arbitrary binary data, and there's no native vector type for image processing or other binary formats within a data frame context. This also means `readstata13` currently cannot create dta files *with* embedded binary data from R.

Using `strlexport = TRUE` and specifying a path with `strlpath`, you can save the contents of `strL` variables as separate files in a designated directory.

```{r}
# Create a directory for exporting strLs
dir.create("res/strls/")

# Read a dta file containing strLs and export their content
dat_strl <- read.dta13("stata_strl.dta",
                       strlexport = TRUE,
                       strlpath = "res/strls/")

# List the files created in the export directory.
# The filenames indicate the variable and observation index (e.g., 15_1).
dir("res/strls/")
```

The exported files do not have extensions because the file type is not inherently known from the `strL` data itself (and could vary cell by cell). The user is responsible for determining the correct file type and processing the content. In this example, the first exported file (`15_1`) is a text file.

```{r}
# Read the content of the text file strL export
readLines("res/strls/15_1")
```

The second file (`16_1`) is a PNG image. You can read and display it using appropriate R packages like `png` and `grid`.

```{r, fig.alt="Display of the R logo extracted from a long string."}
library(png)
library(grid) # grid is needed for grid.raster

# Read the PNG image file
img <- readPNG("res/strls/16_1")

# Display the image
grid::grid.raster(img)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# Clean up the created directory and files
unlink("res/", recursive = TRUE)
```
